✅ Required Feature Implementation

1. Full Customization & Branding

Allow editing of all embed components: title, description, color, footer, thumbnail, image, author, buttons, and emojis.

Add config options for branding (bot name, footer text, embed style) — all editable via command and YAML.

2. Ticket Management Improvements

Add ticket claiming system — staff can “claim” a ticket to mark ownership.

Add priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent) with colored labels and filters.

Add ticket review system — after closure, user can rate staff (1-5 stars) and leave feedback (stored in logs).

Add ticket questions system — custom modals with configurable fields per panel (e.g., “What is your issue?” “Order ID?”).

Add advanced tagging system — staff can attach custom tags (e.g., “Billing”, “Bug”, “Refund”).

3. Automation Features

Add auto-close system (inactivity timeout) with warning messages before closure.

Add working hours system — configurable start/end hours and automatic user notification if ticket created outside support hours.

Add ticket overload system — configurable limit; if too many tickets open, send a notice that support is busy.

Add inactivity monitor — send reminders to staff if tickets remain unresponded to for too long.

4. Logging & Transcripts

Add full logging system (ticket creation, claim, close, reopen, delete, edits).

Add HTML or TXT transcript generator (configurable format, stored locally).

Optionally send transcript to staff log channel or user DM upon closure.

5. Advanced Features

Add AI-powered auto response system (optional, toggleable in config).


Add addon system — ability to load custom JS/TS modules dynamically from /addons directory.

6. Multi-Language & Config

Add lang/ folder with translation JSONs (English default, easy to extend).

Add command /ticket setlanguage <lang> to switch language globally.

Ensure every message uses translation keys instead of hardcoded text.

7. Admin & Analytics

Add /ticket stats command — display analytics (total tickets, avg. response time, staff activity).

Add /ticket logs — view recent ticket actions.

Add /ticket settings — interactive menu to configure inactivity timers, working hours, priorities, etc.

Add permission check for all admin commands (ManageGuild or Admin).

⚙️ Technical Requirements

Use Discord.js v14.15.3

Use TypeScript

Use YAML or JSON for configuration

Maintain compatibility with existing ticket-panels.yml

Use js-yaml for read/write operations

Support auto command registration

Write code in clean, modular architecture (e.g., /commands, /utils, /events, /addons folders)

🧠 Bonus (Optional but Preferred)

Add Dockerfile and .env.example for full self-hosting.

Add license and product info embed (for BuiltByBit listing).

Add startup diagnostics (check if all configs exist, else auto-generate defaults).

Add graceful error logging (log file + console).

✅ Output Expectation

Return a ready-to-use project folder with:

Complete src/ TypeScript source

Updated package.json

All new commands/utilities

Example config.yml and lang/en.yml

README.md describing features and setup
